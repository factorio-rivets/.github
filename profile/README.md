# Rivets ðŸ”©

Welcome to Rivets, a Factorio mod loader written in Rust! Rivets injects code into the Factorio binary via DLL injection, providing a powerful toolset for modding and enhancing the game.

Mods written in Rivets have access to functionality not possible within the traditional Lua API.
- Directly modifiy functionality in the compiled Factorio executable.
- Add new prototypes such as [LinkedRail](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/linked-rail).
- Access to a huge library of crates via the Rust [package manager](https://crates.io/).
- Go blazingly fast with Rust memory safety guarantees and multithreading.
- A superset of all the functionality possible within the vanilla Lua scripting language.

## Features

- **Procedural Macros**: Utilize idiomatic proc macros to overwrite or detour compiled Factorio functions.

Here is an example of how to detour the `main` function:
```rust
#[detour(main)]
fn main(argc: c_int, argv: *const c_char, envp: *const c_char) {
    info!("Detoured into main! ðŸ¦€ðŸ”©");
}
```
This will intercept the `main` function call and execute your custom logic, allowing you to modify the behavior of the game.

- **Seamless interop with Factorio Lua**: Mods written with Rivets can easily subscribe to lua events, and call `remote` API's to share data with Factorio mods written in Lua.

```rust
#[on_event(defines::events::on_player_died)]
fn on_player_died(player_index: u32, cause: LuaEntity) {
    let player: LuaPlayer = game::get_player(player_index);
    player.print("You just lost the game ðŸ’€");
}
```

- **Leverage existing modding infrastructure**: Rivets' design goal is to not reinvent the wheel. Mods written in Rust can be hosted on the offical Factorio modding website. Rivets is also designed to easily allow both Lua and Rust in the same Factorio mod.

## Credits

A huge thank-you to the following crates, without which this project would not be possible.
- [Retour](https://crates.io/crates/retour) - Allows directly modifying Factorio's ASM to detour functions.
- [DLL Syringe](https://crates.io/crates/dll-syringe) - Injects .DLL files into the Factorio executable.
- [PDB](https://crates.io/crates/pdb) - Used to parse the .PDB file format and allows debug symbols to be read on Windows.
- [Gimli](https://crates.io/crates/gimli) - Used to parse the .DWARF file format and allows debug symbols to be read on *nix systems.
- [Bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen) - Automatically generates Rust bindings for Factorio datatypes defined in the .pdb
